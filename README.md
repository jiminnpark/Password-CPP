# Password-CPP
This simple program is just a try of avoiding shoulder surfing attack to some extent.

As a default behaviour of read functions in C/CPP we see the typed keys on the screen but this program help to avoid seeing them and encrypts the character as "*".

- Use of TurboC++/ MSDOS is recommended.
